# CovidAgeDistBE
Example shiny app showing the evolution of age distribution of COVID in Belgium

You can run this one from within RStudio using the command:

```
runGitHub("JoFAM/CovidAgeDistBE")
```

## Goal

This app serves as an example for a course on Shiny. It downloads the data from Epistat on COVID cases in Belgium, and creates a simple interactive plot. Please be kind to the servers of Epistat and don't run this app incessantly

DO NOT USE THIS AS OFFICIAL DATA! THE APP COMES WITHOUT ANY GUARANTEE!
