The numbers of cases are calculated as a rolling average with a window of
a week. This is a naive smoothing technique used to avoid big effects of
differences in reporting between weeks and weekends. The number reported
for each day is the average of the cases reported the week before.
Relative numbers are calculated based on official statistics of be.STAT.
